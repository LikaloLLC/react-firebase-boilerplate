# You shouldn't use this!
There are many great react firebase boilerplates out there. 
I just needed something simple that I can maintain and use for creation of Docsie plugins. 


Instead of using this you should look into boilerplates which IMHO are much better boiler plates.

This is based on tutorial by: http://leanpub.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase

if you still think want to run this make sure you populate the .env file with your firebase configuration
`yarn install`
`yarn build`
