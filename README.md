# You shouldn't use this!
There are many great react firebase boilerplates out there. 
I just needed something simple that I can maintain and use for creation of Docsie plugins. 


Instead of using this you should look into boilerplates which IMHO are much better boiler plates. They got everything!

This is just some copy pasted code based on tutorial by: http://leanpub.com/the-road-to-react-with-firebase

# if you still think want to run this 

1. Make sure you create and populate the .env file with your firebase configuration
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn build`
